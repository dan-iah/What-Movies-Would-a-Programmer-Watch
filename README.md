If you were a programmer, what movie genres would you most likely watch? What about if you were a doctor, or artist?      
In this three person group project completed over seven weeks, we initially set out to explore one main hypothesis: does occupation have an influence on the type of movie genres a person watches? Using the MovieLens dataset, we performed data wrangling through combining information from several files and reformatting the information in the desired layout in the dataframes. We created visualizations to further explore trends and relationships to see what stands out to explore further. In the final stage of the process, as we realised we didn't have sufficient data points to create a reccomender system solely based on peoples occupation, as well as realising that other factors such as gender and age, we decided to build several machine learning models to predict genres based on users' occupation, age, gender, and past users ratings.
